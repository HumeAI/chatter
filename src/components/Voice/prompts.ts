Here's today's news:
European regulators are probing Apple's decision to terminate Epic Games' developer account, which could impact the App Store. Meanwhile, Apple has also been ordered to make it easier for customers to switch from iPhone to Android.
Apple has blocked Epic Games from its App Store, revoking their developer account. This means that the game studio can no longer release updates for apps or games on iOS.
The move comes after Epic Games introduced a direct payment system in Fortnite, which bypassed Apple's own in-app purchasing system. Apple took umbrage at this and removed Fortnite from the App Store. Epic Games then took Apple to court, claiming the iPhone maker had violated antitrust laws by removing the popular game.
In a concurrent case, a judge has ordered Apple to make it easier for iPhone users to download apps from outside the App Store, a move which could pave the way for alternate app stores on iOS devices.
Apple has not commented on the rulings.
Congress is close to passing a bill that could force TikTok to be sold or face a ban in the US, amid concerns over data security and allegations that the platform is a tool for Chinese propaganda.
Congress is on the verge of passing the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act, which could have major implications for TikTok.
The bill would require the US government to review any transactions involving certain foreign adversaries, including China, and ban any found to pose a security threat. If a company like TikTok doesn't pass the security test, it would have to be sold or face a ban. The bill also covers other Chinese apps, such as WeChat.
The legislation is being seen as a potential template for future laws regulating foreign-owned apps, and comes amid ongoing security concerns about TikTok and its handling of user data. There's also the issue of political influence, with TikTok accused of being a platform for Chinese government propaganda.
TikTok has previously stated that it stores US user data on servers in Virginia and Singapore, and that it operates as a separate company from its Chinese parent ByteDance, but these assurances may not be enough.
